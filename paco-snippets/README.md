# paco-snippets README

I have to warn you, this is **my first VSCode** configuration :)

This configuration only have the few custom JavaScript snippets I like to use when I work, I do hope it will help you as much as they help me.

## Features

Those are the snippets:
- `ust`: 'use strict';
- `afn`: ($1) => {$3}$2;
- `adreq`: const $2 = require('$1');
- `clog`: console.log('$1)$2;
- `clog`: console.error('$1)$2;
- `pfn`: Promise((resolve, reject) => {$2});$1

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

This is the first realease, only has JavaScript snippets
